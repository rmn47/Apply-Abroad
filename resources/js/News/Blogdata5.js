                    To study in Australia, the following information will help
                    you decide which class of student visa you need.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You need to obtain an Australian Student Visa to study in
                    Australia. The following are the main Australia Student visa
                    requirement as you must be able to prove to the Department
                    of Home Affairs:
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <ul>
                    <li type="disc">
                        Genuine Temporary Entrant (GTE) requirement
                    </li>
                    <li type="disc">Financial requirement</li>
                    <li type="disc">English Proficiency requirements</li>
                    <li type="disc">Health and character requirements</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    You need to pay the visa application fee and perhaps attend
                    an interview after you have completed an Australian student
                    visa application form.

                <p className="fw-bold">
                    What is Genuine Temporary Entrant (GTE)?
                </p>
                <p>
                    The visa applicant should be able to demonstrate a genuine
                    intention to stay in Australia temporarily for the purpose
                    of study or to accompany a student as a dependent or as a
                    guardian according to the Genuine Temporary Entrant
                    requirement. The following are the factors that the
                    decision-makers at the Department of Home Affairs will
                    consider:
                </p>

                </ul>
                <p>
                    You might be asked to attend an interview at your nearest
                    Australian embassy or consulate to determine whether you
                    meet the GTE requirements. The visa application form needs
                    to be filled only by some of the candidates
                </p>

                    It is for the same visa that the students are applying for:
                    the Student Visa (Subclass 500) this is something that you
                    should apply online.
                    <br />
                    You will need to obtain a Confirmation of Enrolment (COE) or
                    a Letter of Offer confirming you have been accepted into a
                    course registered under the Commonwealth Register of
                    Institutions of Courses or CRICOS before applying for a
                    visa. There is also a deposit fee that you will need to pay.
                    <br />
                    To study in Australia at the same or higher study level, you
                    will be able to change course afterwards. But, if you are
                    changing course to a lower level on the Australian
                    Qualification Framework or an non-AQL level course, you need
                    to apply for a new visa. By studying two or more courses on
                    your Student Visa, where there is a clear progression from
                    one course to another you may also package your studies.
