                    To study in Canada, the following information will help you
                    decide which class of student visa you need.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You will have to obtain a Canadian study permit that serves
                    as a Canadian student visa for the duration of your stay in
                    order to study in Canada.
                </p>

                <p className="fw-bold">Overview</p>
                <p>
                    If your course or program last six months or less, you will
                    not need a Canadian study permit. If you decide you wish to
                    continue your studies on another program, you will need to
                    leave Canada to apply for a study permit through a visa
                    office as you might want to apply for a student permit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can apply to renew it from within Canada if you decide
                    to continue your study permit. A study permit also allows
                    you to work part-time on campus for full-time students
                    registered at an accredited higher education institution. As
                    part of your program, stay in Canada as a permanent resident
                    or find work after you graduate as you may also be able to
                    work off-campus, work as a co-op or intern as part of your
                    program.
